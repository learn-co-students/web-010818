# API Authentication with Rails - Tokens

### Objectives
- Understand why authentication tokens are commonly used when interacting with APIs
- Add a token strategy to an application
- Authenticate a user based on their token

### Preparation

- Build a basic Rails API
- Understand foundational concepts in authentication & encryption


##The authentication problem
The HTTP protocol is _stateless_. This means the server does not remember anything about a client between requests. So if we authenticate a user with a username and password, then on the next request, our application won't remember us.


The _old way_ of dealing with this was to store who was logged in on the server. Every time the server received a request from a client, it would check to see if that client was logged in or not. This is not very efficient:

1) Every time a user logs in, the server has to create a record somewhere on the server. If lots of users are logging in, the overhead on our server increases.

2) If the logged in information is stored in local memory on a server, the user will only be able to make requests to that server. This is not ideal - what if we have a bunch of servers, but most of the users are forced into using the original server they logged in at?

There are a few other problems, but these two are the main ones.


## Tokens, The Basics - Intro (10 mins)
Token-based authentication is stateless. We are not storing any information about a logged in user on the server. No stored information means your applicaiton can scale and add more machines as necessary without worrying about where a user is logged in.

Here is the JWT authentication flow:


	User requests access with username and password

					|
					|

	The app validates the credentials

					|
					|

	The app gives a signed token to the client

					|
					|

	The client stores the token and presents it with every request


## So what does a JWT look like?

Just three strings, separated by periods:

	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.ccccccccccccccccccc

The first part (aaaaaaaaaaaa) is the header

The second part (bbbbbbbbbbbb) is the payload - the good stuff, like who this person is, and their id in our database.

The third part (ccccccccccccc) is the signature. The signature is a hash of the header and the payload. It is hashed with a secret key, that we will provide.


Head on over to [jwt.io](http://jwt.io/#debugger) and see what I mean:

#### Just like cookies, mmmm....

In the example above, you'll notice that there are 3 parts. The payload is the one we care the most about, and it holds whatever data we decide to put in there. It's very much like a cookie; we put as few things in there as possible â€“ just the pieces we really need.

Applications can save a JWT somewhere on a user's computer, just like a cookie. Because JWTs can be encrypted into a single string, we can _also_ send it over HTTP really, really easily. Which means it'll work in any server/client scenario you can imagine. Quite nice.



## Let's PARTY ON CODE!

Let's take a few minutes to look at the rails api code.

What I want to do is limit our API so that you can only get the user data from it IF you have been authenticated.

We will need to build a current_user/authenticate route that will check a user's password against the stored (and hashed) version in our database. If they match, our API will return a JWT. We then need to take that JWT and include it in all our later requests to prove that we are logged in.




## Create a user

Open up rails console and get a user in there:

```ruby
User.create({username: 'johannkerr',password:'mustlovecats'})
```

## Authenticating a user and returning a JWT Server-Side

This authentication is going to take place in our auth controller and application controller file, where we previously said that authentication would take place.

Let's first install the necessary JWT gem:


```
$ gem 'jwt'
```

We also need to provide a string that will serve as the secret signing key used in the hashing of the header and payload, to make up the third part of the JWT string

```
secret = "supersecretcode"
```

The algorithim as well:

```
algorithm = "HS256"
```


>Explain JWT.encode && JWT.decode


Let's make sure we have all the required routes. Auth is where a user will send a POST request with a username and password. I.e. this is the route they will use to login. I guess we could have called it http://localhost:3000/api/v1/login

So let's write the machinery to generate a JWT and validate it:

Here's some pseudo-code of what I want to do -

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  include ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Token::ControllerMethods
  before_action :authorized





  def issue_token(payload)
    JWT.encode(payload, "supersecretcode")
  end


  def current_user
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_token do |jwt_token, options|
      begin
        decoded_token = JWT.decode(jwt_token, "supersecretcode")

      rescue JWT::DecodeError
        return nil
      end

      if decoded_token[0]["user_id"]
        @current_user ||= User.find(decoded_token[0]["user_id"])
      else
      end
    end
  end

  def logged_in?
    !!current_user
  end

  def authorized
    render json: {message: "Not welcome" }, status: 401 unless logged_in?
  end


end


```


And here is what the sessions controller should look like -

```ruby
class Api::V1::SessionsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :authorized, only: [:create]

  def show
    render json: {
      id: current_user.id,
      username: current_user.username
    }
  end

  def create

    user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])
    if user && user.authenticate(params[:password])
      payload = {user_id: user.id}
      token = issue_token(payload)
      render json: { jwt: token, yay: true }
    else
      render json: { error: "some bad stuff happened"}
    end
  end
end
```
